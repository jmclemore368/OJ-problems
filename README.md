# OJ-problems
Solutions to problems on common OJ platforms.

* While the problems in this repository do NOT aim to be micro-optimized solutions, the problems in this repository DO aim to achieve the optimal Big-O time complexity,
* The goal is to help myself and others *understand* the problem on a deep level. As such, readibility is emphasized, and obfuscated code is avoided.
* To this end, I try to refrain from using quirky language constructs and may often be more verbose than necessary.
