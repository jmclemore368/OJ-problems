# problems

The code in this repository will be in Java. With the help of some friends, perhaps the doors will open to other languages.


Includes problem solutions *and* translations of examples within computer sciences texts such as The Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena:

Includes solutions to problems on common OJ platforms such as LeetCode and HackerRank:
* Solutions to OJ problems do NOT aim to be micro-optimized solutions, however they do aim to achieve optimal Big-O time complexity,
* The goal is to help myself and others *understand* the problem on a deep level. As such, readibility is emphasized, and obfuscated code is avoided.
* To this end, I try to refrain from using quirky language constructs and may often be more verbose than necessary.
