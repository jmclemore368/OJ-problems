# problems

## What is the purpose of this repository?
1. To provide solutions to problems within various computer science textbooks and OJ platforms.
  * I.e., providing solutions to the end-of-chapter problems within Skiena's *The Algorithm Design Manual*.
  * I.e., providing solutions to the many questions on [leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com).
2. To provide translations of source code (and pseudo-code) within various computer science textbooks to Java
  * I.e., translating all of the in-text examples within Skiena's *The Algorithm Design Manual* from C to Java.

## Will everything only be in Java?
Yes. I'm open to any help if you would like to contribute solutions or translations in another language.

## Any disclaimers?
* Beware of incorrect solutions. I am merely an undergraduate student trying to do his good deed for the world. Please raise issues and submit pull requests as necessary.
