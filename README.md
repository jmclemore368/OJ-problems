# problems

1. This repository houses my own original translations of the problems contained within the book *Elements of Programming Interviews, by Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, and Tsung-Hsien Lee* into Python 2.7.12
   * Buy the book [here in Java](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1517671272/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) or [here in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)
   
2. To respect the author's work, I do not docstring or comment anything beyond what the author's have chosen to display in their own public GitHub repository. Occasionally, I will make original comments to clarify Pythonic idiosyncrasies.
   * See the original ideas [here](https://github.com/adnanaziz/epicode)

4. Accounting for the above, this repository otherwise attempts to follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
